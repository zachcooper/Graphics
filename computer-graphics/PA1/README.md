# PA1: Input Interactions

The given spinning cube has been modified to orbit around a central point, while also spinning itself. This is done by multipyling the translate and rotate function.

The project also added a vertex and fragment shader text file. Currently, the name of those two files are hard coded into the shader.cpp file. In the next update I would like to have those entered into the command line when executing the code.
