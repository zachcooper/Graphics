# PA10: Lighting

Robert Trimble  
Andrew Munoz  
Zach Cooper  

The following project builds off of code from PA9. There are three cylinders instead of one.   
The table is now a triMesh, thus the dividing wall has collision detection. Can now launch the ball.   
And the cylinders "bumpers" apply force when colliding with the ball.  

## Building and Running
The following project was built on Linux/ubuntu. To build this project,   
simply go into the computer-graphics/PA10 directory, and enter the following command lines.  

```bash  
mkdir build  
cd build  
cp ../makefile .  
make  
./Assignment10  
```

##Controls:
Arrow keys move the cube in respective direction.  
q - lowers ambient lighting on the table  
w - raises ambient lighting on the table  
a - lowers specular lighting on the cylinder  
s - raises specular lighting on the cylinder  
space bar - toggle per vertex and per fragment shading  
left mouse click - launch the ball
